Create a new quick note in a floating [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) window (on command or by right-clicking the Obsidian app icon). This started from a [feature request](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/create-new-note-from-right-clicking-app-icon/63210) in the Obsidian forum.

# TODO
- [ ] Add a setting for changing the quick note title
- [ ] Windows support (docs: [Windows Taskbar JumpList](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/windows-taskbar))
- [ ] Linux support (docs: [Linux Desktop Launcher Actions](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/linux-desktop-actions))

Changes welcome! Please don't hesitate to open an issue if you spot a problem or propose an enhancement with a pull request. I don't have reliable access to a Windows or desktop Linux machine for testing so any help with the to-do items would be warmly received.
